## Learning Goals
1. More on Site Design
1. CSS Layouts - Floats

## Mastery Project
The mastery project is a coding "exam" where you show that you are proficient in laying out a web page using floats and positioning. I will introduce the prompt this coming Sunday (3/28) and you will have the week to complete it. It is not timed. It will be worth the same % of your final grade. More to come on Sunday!
