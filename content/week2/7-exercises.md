# Knowledge Check
You should be able to answer these questions.
1. What's the difference between an absolute and relative URL?
1. What does the `href` of an email link look like?
1. What are the three different image formats we discussed? Why would you choose one over another?
1. Why set a height/width on an image tag?
1. What's the difference between an **inline** element and a **block** element?

# Exercises
This exercise gives you the opportunity to examine if you are keeping up with the additional content we’ve been covering in class. In addition to the items addressed in Week #1's homework, you should now be able to:
1. Understand where your files are located
1. Comprehend the differences between relative and absolute paths
1. Add hyperlinks to your html documents
1. Add imagery into your html documents
1. Build a table using html

Generate a small web site of four pages. For content, make three of the pages written assignments from other classes. In other words, take three assignments from earlier classes and mark them up as you did with your response to Exercise 1. Sprinkle in some additional links to relevant material and add in some images as well. Finally, link out to all of these files from the home page and create a table on that home page the includes the title of the work, the course it was written for, and the grade you think you should have received for it. The web site should include:
1. A home page with links out to three additional documents that you’ve marked up
1. Hyperlinks with both relative and absolute syntax
1. Some images that are at least tangentially related to the content
1. A table on the home page

In the end, you should end up with four html files. If you load them into a browser they should render correctly. Your hyperlinks should take you back and forth between the pages and/or sections of content. All of this depends on what content you are using – so everyone’s work and code will be a little different. 

All markup for this project should be in accordance with the HTML5 specification. Run it through the HTML validator to confirm.

When you've completed the following exercises, make a zip of your Week 2 exercises (Week2-FirstNameLastName) and email it to me. These will be graded on "best effort".
