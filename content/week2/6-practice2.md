<p>In this section, we're going to write some code with fewer explicit instructions. You'll want to make a new folder for these exercises.</p>

**Scenario:**
You and a friend decide to start a web development business called **DubJay Designs**. Your friend comes up with a design for your marketing website, and you've agreed to code it.

**Some questions to ask yourself when you think you're done with each part:**
1. Does it validate?
1. Are child elements indented?
1. Are my images accessible?
1. Do all of my tags have an opening and ending tag?
1. Are element choices semantically correct?
1. Is my text formatted correctly (strong, emphasized)?

### Exercise 1: Home Page
Based on the image below (also called a "mockup"), create an HTML page called `index.html`. It should be HTML compliant and all formatting (line breaks, text formatting, paragraphs, images) should match. Set the title to "Home | Week 2". Once completed, validate your code using the <a target="_blank" href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">W3 Validator</a>. The logo image to use is available for download below.

**Logo to download and use** (right-click, save to your images folder):
<div class="left-img">
  <img style="width: initial" src="https://kauffeem-public.s3.amazonaws.com/cis275/dubjaydesignlogo.png" alt="DubJay Designs logo" />
</div>

### Exercise 2: Tables
Potential clients have been asking you about how much everything costs. Based on the image below, create a new HTML page called `pricing.html`. Set the title to "Pricing | Lecture 5". Include the same logo above the heading like you did in Exercise 1. Once completed, validate your code using the <a target="_blank" href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">W3 Validator</a>.

### Exercise 3: Links
On the index.html page, add a link at the bottom of the page that links to the Pricing Page. On the pricing page, add a link to the bottom that says "Back to home" and takes you back to the index.html page.
