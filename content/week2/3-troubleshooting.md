## Review
1. HTML5 is a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
1. HTML structural elements, basic syntax
1. Images (use `img` not `image`)
1. Links

## Saving Files
- Cloud service (icloud/Dropbox, Box, Google Drive)
- flash drive
- git (learning curve but most useful)

## Troubleshooting/Tips
1. When you make a tag, make the first and last immediately: `<html></html>`
1. If an element is inside another one, it should be indented for readibility.
1. If something is displaying incorrectly, go through each of your tags. Find the starting and ending tag.
1. If something isn't displaying at all, make sure you have a body tag and your missing element is inside of it.
1. Keyboard shortcuts (save, copy/paste/cut, select)
1. Copy and paste your code into the <a target="_blank" href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">W3 Validator</a>
