## Review of Concepts
We've covered in detail positioning and layouts. So far in our web design and development toolkit we have HTML, design basics including some color theory, typography, and CRAP principles, we have CSS, and we know how to make page layouts. At this point, you have a lot of the technical skills needed to make websites. Nice! In the next two weeks, we'll be starting our second book, **Don't Make Me Think by Krug**. If you don't have this book yet, you should think about finding it soon. It's pretty inexpensive and a lot of publishers have made books free online during the pandemic, so that might be worth checking out.
