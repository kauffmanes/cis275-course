# Review
1. What are the three main languages used in web development? What are they used for?
1. What can I find in the HTML Head section? What about the body?
1. What is the minimum software needed to make a web page?
1. What tag is used to populate the browser bar in a web page?


# In Class Exercises
## Exercise 1: Environment Setup
### Part A:
1. Download or find a text editor on your system (Atom should be pre-installed on school computers).
1. Download or find a browser to use.
1. If you haven't already, make a folder to hold your lecture 3 activities.
1. Create a new web page (HTML document) labeled `exercise1.html`.
1. Make sure it has a doctype and HTML section. A HEAD section is not needed yet.
1. In the body (you'll have to make a body element), add content to the document so that you have a level one heading that says 'My first website!'.
1. Add a paragraph descibing something you learned in this class so far.
1. Test it in the browser. Check out the URL. What is this type of URL? Compare it to your neighbor's.
1. Test it in a different browser. Are there any noticeable differences? If yes, why might they look differently?

### Part B:
1. Add a HEAD section to your `exercise1.html`.
1. Give your page a title called **Exercise 1** and test it in the browser.
1. Add your charset meta tag and set it to "utf-8".

## Exercise 2
<!-- Create a book citation for HTML & CSS by Duckett using a format of your choice (MLA, APA, Chicago, etc). It should include all of the text formatting required (italic, bold, underline, etc). If the citation requires that the second line of the citation be tabbed, ignore this. -->
1. Create a page called `exercise2.html`.
1. Make sure to include all relevant HTML tags (doctype, HEAD)
1. Set your title to **Exercise 2** and set your charset meta tag to "utf-8".
1. Choose five words that are specific to your major.
1. In your page body, create a definition list that includes each term with its associated definition.

## Exercise 3
Make up (or find online) a simple food recipe. We're going to markup the recipe in HTML. Don't spend too much time on this step!

1. Create a new HTML document with the correct doctype. Create a HEAD section with a title, charset, and author meta tags defined.
1. Save it as **exercise3.html**.
1. Make a body tag to hold the contents.
1. Make a level one heading tag (`h1`) where the text is the name of the recipe.
1. Next, make an *unordered list* of the ingredients.
1. Next, make an *ordered list* of the steps to make your recipe.
1. Finish with a short *paragraph* (one or two sentences) of your choice. It could be a tip on how to make the recipe, a description of the recipe, why you chose this recipe, or something else.
1. Show me when you're done!

Try to do this without looking, but here's an example if you're stuck: <a href="https://gist.github.com/kauffmanes/08f517433f06fb2b97284f9452d8ff5a" target="_blank">Cookie Recipe</a>

<!-- 1. Find any (appropriate) image on the internet. Copy the link to the image, to be used later.
1. Find two more images and download these.
1. Make a folder labeled "images" in the same directory as your index page. Place one of your downloaded images in that folder. Place the other image in the same folder as your index.html.
1. Add an image element to your body (`img`). Make the `src` attribute point to the link you recorded in the previous step. Make sure you include an `alt` tag.
1. Make two more image elements. Make the src attribute of one point to your image in the images folder and the other should point to the image in the same directory as the index.html.
1. Let me know when you're done. -->

<!-- Me: there should be two identical images -->

## Exercise 4

By this point, we've covered the basic HTML structure, some new elements, naming conventions, and workspace setup. This exercise will be an indicator for whether you've learned the content.

Read <a target="_blank" href="https://www.impactbnd.com/blog/what-it-means-to-make-your-website-accessible">this article</a> on why website accessibility is important. Reflect on the reading and write a short response, about 250 words. Next, markup the response using HTML so that it renders correctly in the browser. You'll only need to generate one HTML file for this. In the browser, the line breaks, emphasis, and any other typographic formatting should be present.

All markup should be in accordance with the HTML5 specification. Validate it using this tool: <a target="_blank" href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input</a>
