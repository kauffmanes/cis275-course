## Intro
Last week, we talked about the web design and development process. We want to start on that for our final projects.
You'll take an approach similar to what we did with [Alice's website](/week11).

## Final Project
We are going to start a simple project proposal for our final projects. **This is not something you need to hand in. It's for your own benefit and will help you make a better website.** A common interview question is how you go about planning a project from start to finish. The skills you learn here will allow you to succintly answer that question. Take the output of each of these steps and incorporate them into the proposal, so you have a document to refer back to when developing.

### Step 1: Brainstorming
Start thinking about what you want out of a website. If you were making this for someone else (like you did for Alice's bike shop),
this stage could be in the shape of an interview. The goal is to brainstorm what you'd like to show off about yourself. You don't need
to use any format for this. I like to just make a bulleted list of notes that I can later organize. See [Week 11](/week11) for an example of the Alice interview notes.

### Step 2: Understanding the Problem
These steps might look familar because you did them in Week 11. You do not need to do all of them again but you should write a few as practice and to better understand who you're trying to serve with your website.

1. Write a succinct statement defining the goal of the website. You can use this statement to guide your decisions about your site. If the content or new feature you want to add do not contribute to solving this problem, then you probably don't need it!
1. Write four question about the people who might be interested in the site (see pg. 455).
1. Create two fictional visitors and create a table that answers your five questions (see pg. 456).
1. What are they trying to achieve? Write a story for each of your users (see pg. 458).

### Step 3: Features
Now that you know the problem you're trying to solve and who/how people will use your site, come up with a list of features. These could include social media integration, a photo gallery, about page, contact form, etc. They should be features that help to showcase your skills and are geared toward your audience.

### Step 4: Designing the Infrastructure
1. Create a sitemap for the new website that encompasses the information from your brainstorming.
1. For the features that require copy, start writing this. Remember, content drives design and so you should have a basic idea of the text you're going to include before you design the page.
1. Create wireframes for the pages. If you have access to the Adobe Suite through W&amp;J, XD is a great program for this. You can also use Photoshop, find free wireframing applications, or just drawn them out on a piece of paper. They do not need to be pixel-perfect (meaning they don't need to look exactly like your final site).

### Step 5: Make it!
Now that you have a plan and a proposal, start building your website using all of the skills you've developed over the semester: HTML, CSS, keep in mind CRAP principles, typography, accessibility, color theory...This project is as much about design as it is development.

## Class Exercises
Comment in the week 12 channel:
1. The website you'd like to make for this project. Are you showcasing your writing? Your graphic design projects? Photography?
1. One question or confusion that you may have on planning, development, or deadlines.
