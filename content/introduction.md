Welcome to CIS 275! I'm excited to introduce you to the world of web design and development. This course assumes that you have no coding experience, at least in the web technologies that we'll be covering. It does assume, however, that you have access to a computer, are able to use a browser, can use a mouse, etc. If any of this is a problem, please let me know.

## Who am I?
![Emily standing in Svalbard](https://kauffeem-public.s3.amazonaws.com/cis275/emily.jpg)

My name is **Emily Kauffman**. Presently, I am a frontend software engineer at <a href="https://harvie.farm" target="_blank">Harvie</a>. I focus on application development and my day consists of designing web pages, writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. What we're going to cover this semester are some of the building blocks of what I use every day and I'm excited to pass along what I've learned. I'm also a W&J alum!

For fun, I like to read, hike, and travel. I'm currently living in Guam and have recently discovered scuba diving! I work remotely (perks of the career!) and post-COVID, hope to travel a lot more while working.

# Explanation of the course site
Since this is a web course, everything will be web-based. Each week will have one or more associated web pages with an overview of the covered content, helpful links, homework, and code snippets. To view an overview of the week's content, click on, for example, "Week 1" in the sidebar. You'll see an overview of the content, any notes I have for you, and anything that's due.

Our class discussions will all be on Microsoft Teams. You should have all been added to our team by now. Let me know if you can't get in.

## Code Snippets
These are some examples of code snippets:

```html
<!-- this is some HTML -->
<p>I'm a paragraph!</p>
```

```css
/* this is some CSS */
p {
  color: red;
}
```

# Tools to use
This is really up to you. You'll need a text editor, a web browser, and a computer. A few popular editors are Sublime, Atom, and VSCode. If you're in the classroom, the computers should have Atom installed on them. You'll want to fully test your websites in all of the main browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc), but you can choose any as your main testing browser. I like to use Chrome because of their development tools. Finally, you can use almost any computer for this class.

There are online code editors such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io) that can be very useful for collaborating with others. I'll more than likely be using this in my lectures and could send CodePen links for class exercises.

# Trusted Resources
There are many resources for web design & development on the web. Many are not trustworthy; they're out of date or just completely incorrect. The sites listed below are great resources. More than likely, this list will grow throughout the semester.
