## Introduction
Welcome to CIS 275! I'm excited to introduce you to the world of web design and development. This course assumes that you have no coding experience, at least in the web technologies that we'll be covering. It does assume, however, that you have access to a computer, are able to use a browser, can use a mouse, etc. If any of this is a problem, please let me know.

### Who am I?
![Discovery Robotics Team](https://discoveryrobotics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/DR_ConventionCtr08_1699_Final_190319.jpg)

My name is Emily Kauffman. Presently, I am a software engineer at <a href="https://discoveryrobotics.com" target="_blank">Discovery Robotics</a>. I focus on application development and haptic interface design. This is a fancy way of saying that I develop the touch screen application that the user interacts with on the physical robot. What we're going to cover this semester are the some of the building blocks of what I use every day and I'm excited to pass along what I've learned.

## Explanation of the course site
Since this is a web course, everything will be web-based, including the syllabus (save the trees!). The syllabus will include all of the basic course info, as well as links for each class page. Each class will have one or more associated web pages with an overview of the covered content, helpful links, homework, and code snippets.

### Disqus
Each class page has a section to leave comments. My site uses <a href="https://disqus.com/" target="_blank">Disqus</a>, which is the most common global commenting system on the web. If you have a question or comment, I recommend asking it on the course page so that everyone can see it. You're also welcome to collaborate/answer others questions, or report issues with the content. Collaboration here is the goal. Guest commenting is enabled if you don't want to make an account.

### Code Snippets
This are some examples of code snippets:

```html
<!-- this is some HTML -->
<p>I'm a paragraph!</p>
```

```css
/* this is some CSS */
p {
  color: red;
}
```

## Tools to use
This is really up to you. You'll need a text editor, a web browser, and a computer. A few popular editors are Sublime, Atom, and VSCode. The computers in this classroom should have Atom installed on them. You'll want to fully test your websites in all of the main browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc), but you can choose any as your main testing browser. I like to use Chrome because of their development tools. Finally, you can use almost any computer for this class!
