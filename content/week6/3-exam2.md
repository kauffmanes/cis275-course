## Next Class
- **Homework**: Read Duckett Chps. 15 & 17 for 3/17 (I know you already read 15... skim it again!)
- **Extra credit**: Visit a PAL tutor during hours. Have them sign a piece of paper with their name and date. Write down what they helped you with. Give it to me for a bonus point toward something.
- **Optional practice**: Make a codecademy.com account (free) and start the HTML/CSS track.
