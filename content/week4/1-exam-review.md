# Review with Codeacademy
There is a website called [Codeacademy](https://codeacademy.com) that walks you through writing HTML. It's extremely helpful because it gives immediate feedback on your code. It can be an awesome way to review the concepts we've learned this far. If you decide to try it out, be forewarned that they may mention a few elements that we haven't talked about yet, but they should be fairly self-explanatory. You'll need to make an account (it's free), find the HTML track, and just follow the prompts.

# The Exam
Next week you'll be taking your first exam. It will include anything that we've covered so far this semester including chapters 1-8 from the Duckett book, the Web lectures, or course videos.

1. **Week 1** - What is the web/history/how does it work, Basic structure/syntax, Text
1. **Week 2** - Hyperlinks, Images, Tables
1. **week 3** - Forms, additional markup

## Format
It will consist of some short answer, fill in the blank, and a number of coding challenges where you'll download some source code, make changes to it based on the question prompt, and then reupload the code. It will be open notes, book, and internet. It will be timed, probably around the length of a class period.

## Practice
In the next module, you'll do a practice quiz that mimics the format of the test. The goal is for you to concentrate on writing your best code and not spend your whole exam period struggling with the software.

# The ~Quiz~
I'm calling this a quiz so it feels like test prep. It's mostly supposed to serve as a dry-run for how you'll take the real test next week. If you don't submit this, I'll bug you because I want to make sure you can submit the test! 

1. Go to https://sakai.washjeff.edu/samigo-app/servlet/Login?id=d23f7388-ecad-4d09-8b63-5a097f32f59a1613391725468. You may need to sign in. It should load the Quiz called "Quiz #1: HTML". 
1. Some questions will have question text with the prompt, as well as an attachment that includes a zip or an .html document. Download this attachment to your own computer. It may be helpful to make a new folder called "Quiz1" or something, to organize these documents.
1. Read the question prompt and make any appropriate changes to the downloaded file. When you're done, save the file and upload it to Question 1 using the File Upload section in the question.
1. Repeat for each question.

Now is the time to let me know if you can't access something, you're confused, or things just aren't working. I want to get all of the issues worked out *this week* instead of next!
