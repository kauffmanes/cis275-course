**THIS LECTURE WILL NOT BE ON THE HTML TEST!**

In this section, we're going to start thinking about design! This is the point where the class really starts to get interesting. Up until this point, most of our sites have all looked the same - white background, black text, all the content displayed left-to-right and top-to-bottom, like a written document.

# Goals
1. Learn to make designs that don't suck
1. Build a vocabulary for talking about design
1. Under how content drives design
1. Understanding the relationship between function and aesthetics
