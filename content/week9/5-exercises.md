Through this exercise you’ll develop the ability to create basic layouts for web pages by using CSS for positioning. To successfully complete this task you should be able to exhibit mastery of:
1. Fully understand the box model
1. Comprehend *why* you need to understand the Box Model
1. Research and understand the five modes of positioning
1. Generate carefully edited HTML and CSS with absolutely no errors (validate!)
1. Understand the differences between fixed and fluid layouts

**Here's what you should do:**
Generate two web pages using DIVs, HTML5 structural elements, and **internal** CSS for controlling layout and appearance.

You should make sure your work includes:
1. Two separate files – a fixed layout at 960px, and a fluid layout at 80%.
1. All the necessary styling for both appearance and layout.
1. Appropriate comments for all your code in both HTML and CSS.
1. Lorem ipsum filler text (traditional, or a fun one).
1. Any imagery you deem appropriate.

This represents the minimum you should do to successfully complete the exercise. You should feel free to go further – such practice will only improve your skills. All markup for this project should be in accordance with the HTML5 and CSS3 specifications. A super-simple fixed layout example might look like this:
