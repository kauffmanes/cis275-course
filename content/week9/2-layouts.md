## Fixed Width Layouts
- Fixed width layouts do not change size as the user increases or decreases the the size of their browser window
- Measurements tend to be given in pixels
- Example on pg. Duckett 383

### Advantages
- Pixel values are accurate at controlling size/position
- Designer has greater control over layouts

### Disadvantages
- On big screens, you can end up with big gaps on either side
- If a user has a high res screen, it can look too small
- If user increases font size, it may not fit properly in the fixed width

## Liquid (fluid) Layouts
- Liquid layouts stretch and contract as a user increases or decreases the browser window
- Measurements tend to be given using percentages
- Example on pg. Duckett 385

### Advantages
- Pages expand to fill the entire browser window so there are no spaces around the page on a large screen
- If the user has a small window, the page can contract to fit it without the user having to scroll to the side.
- The design is tolerant of users setting font sizes larger than the designer intended (because the page can stretch).

### Disadvantages
- If you do not control the width of sections of the page then the design can look very different than you intended, with unexpected gaps around certain elements or items squashed together.
- If the user has a wide window, lines of text can become very long, which makes them harder to read.
- If the user has a very narrow window, words may be squashed and you can end up with few words on each line.
