We've touched on layouts with floats previously but here we'll go a little deeper and get some more practice! I've made a number of videos to explain these concepts and I recommend following along in your text editor. I'm using an online tool called [Dabblet](https://dabblet.com/) that lets you code in real time. It's a great way to try out code quickly.

## Review of Floats

- With a float, the vertical alignment is normal (top of aligns with top of containing block element) but horizontal is adjustable.
- Surrounding inline content will flow around opposite side.
- Float property can be set to left, right, none, or inherit.
- Remember: make sure width is specified, float elements can overlap other boxes, you can use the clear property to adjust
