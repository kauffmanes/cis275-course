# Review
The goal for this week is to make sure everyone is good to go on the content we've learned this far and is comfortable with the test format. In the Exam Review section, you'll take a quiz that is similar to how the test will look. I'm also going to be holding two live Zoom calls this week for anyone to pop in if they have questions or need a demo.

# Live Sessions
These are optional and the goal is to do demos and answer specific questions. If you can't make either of these and still want to chat, let me know.

1. Thursday, Feb. 18 at 5:15 PM
1. Monday, Feb. 22 at 5:15 PM

Join on Microsoft Teams at those times. I'll add a link beforehand.

# PAL Tutors
