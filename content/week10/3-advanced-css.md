I'm going to cover a few advanced things in CSS that you might find useful for either of the
upcoming projects. There's no way to memorize all of this (nor should you try), but you should at least know that they are options. This lets you make more
advanced web design designs. We're going to work through a number of the examples in the W3schools tutorials.

For each section, read the associated article and then watch the demo video.

## CSS Units
I'm including this because someone asked about different CSS units. We are going to cover some of these in the next few weeks with responsive web design, but if you're curious, read these two (short) articles.

## Opacity and Transparency
This article deals with changing the opacity of elements on your page. This one could be helpful for your photo gallery project, if you wanted to add an effect like this on your photos.
