## Introduction of the Mastery Project
The mastery exam was meant to be a coding exam that was completed in the classroom to demonstrate that you were familiar with layouts and positioning, and able to recreate a site based on a mock up. That is no longer feasible due to this class being remote, and so I've come up with a project that accomplishes similar goals.

### Prompt
You're a famous photographer! When did that happen?? Anyway, you've decided that you want to show off your photos by making a photography site. These photos do not have to be good. We're just working on our layout skills!

**You have a lot of creative freedom here, but you should make sure your work falls within these constraints:**
1. Must have a landing page (index.html).
1. The landing page must contain *at least* 8 photos displayed in a grid. This grid can be in whatever dimensions you want, but it must have at least two columns and at least two rows (this means no 8x1 or 1x8 configurations). You can do more than 8 photos if you want.
1. The landing page and photo grid must be laid out using a fluid layout (should use flexbox or floats, not fixed).
1. Each photo on your landing page must link to a page specific to that image.
1. The site should include the typical web page components: header, title, footer, navigation.
1. Each individual photography page should include at a minimum: the image, a caption, and a paragraph or two about the photo.
1. Each individual photography page should include at least two columns in the layout.

This represents the minimum you should do to successfully complete the project. You should feel free to go further â€“ such practice will only improve your skills. All markup for this project should be in accordance with the HTML5 and CSS3 specifications. Feel free to be as creative as you want here! I'm excited to see what you come up with.

I don't care if you use other photography websites as motivation, in fact, I encourage it! Just make sure all the code that you write is your own.

## Dates
This will be due on April 7th at 11:59 PM. Note - this is a Wednesday. I'm giving a few extra days to work on it, so I'm expecting a solid design and layout, proper naming, and no coding errors.

### Grading
The project will be worth 30% of your grade. The rubric:
- 10% design decisions (CRAP principles)
- 30% correctness of HTML (semantics and syntax)
- 30% correctness of CSS (semantics and syntax)
- 30% fulfills layout requirements above
