*Flexible Box Module, aka flexbox, "aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute
space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic" (1).*

- Designed as a 1D layout model and as a method that could offer space distribution between items in an interface
- Powerful tool for alignment (remember the height issue of a sidebar/main content?)
- Can be used in place of floats for layout a lot of the time
- Best used for small scale layouts (CSS Grid Layout is better for large, complex layouts)
- [Browser Support Table](https://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox)
