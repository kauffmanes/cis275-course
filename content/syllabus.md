# Course Description
This semester we will closely consider the web, think about its impact upon culture, and develop technical skills for generating effective web content. This course focuses primarily upon the development of coding skills for generating web content, as well as an aptitude for creating effective designs and interfaces. In addition, this course is designed to help students develop the ability to produce an informed critique of Internet resources, as well as a capacity for evaluation of web materials (Fee 1).

# Student Outcomes
As a student in this course, you’ll be exposed to numerous web designs, and you will learn to evaluate and discuss the primary design elements of the Web through both conversation and writing. In addition, you’ll learn how to efficiently program relatively advanced web designs. Finally, you’ll also gain the opportunity to think critically about the web and its influence on our culture, and represent that thought through your own development projects and writing (Fee 1).

# Course Prerequisites
There are no prerequesites for this course.

# Reference Materials
In addition to these two books, there may be assigned readings based on current topics and events. The Duckett book will be used soon so buy that one first.

1. Duckett, J. (2011). HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites. ISBN-13: 978-1118008188
1. Krug, S. Don't Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability (3rd Edition)

# Grading and Assignments
| Assignment | % of grade |
| ----- | ----- |
| HTML Exam | 15% |
| CSS Exam | 15% |
| Homework & Weekly Participation | 15% |
| Layout Project | 25% |
| Personal Website | 30% | 

The only way to really learn this type of content is to do it every week. To that end, I'll be assigning exercises to complete on your own. If you get stuck, contact the PAL tutors, or email me.

# Getting Help
There are PAL tutors available to help with your course work. They can be found on the second floor of the Tech Center, either in the lounge.

<a href="mailto:manginogf@washjeff.edu">Gianni Mangino</a>: Monday and Wednesday, 7:00-10:00 PM <br/>
<a href="mailto:berbackrj@washjeff.edu">Ryan Berback</a>: Tuesday, 7:00-10:00 PM

You can also email me at <a href="mailto:ekauffman@washjeff.edu">ekauffman@washjeff.edu</a> with questions.

# Schedule
As you're (hopefully) aware, this class is asynchronous. This means that it is on you to complete the course work on your own during the week.The content "week" will start on each Tuesday. This is when I will post any announcements/expect you to read the weekly overview (on the course site). Even though the semester's content may be available earlier, it is subject to change up until each Tuesday.

I will post two classes worth of information each week on Tuesday. You will be expected to complete any required reading, content, exercises, and homework during the week. All materials will be due by **midnight** on Sunday. This gives me a day to review and make adjustments to the upcoming week if needed (e.g. if everyone is confused on the prior week's content, I'll adjust the upcoming week to include more of that).

The typical structure will include video lectures focused on the assigned reading. The rest of the week will involve working on activities and/or discussions.

# Final Notes
There are no "excused" absences in this class because there are no "in-person" classes. If you don't participate each week through discussions or exercises, this will impact your final grade.

Any late assignment will be docked one full letter grade for each day that it's late. You should have plenty of time to complete them with many resources available to you for when you're stuck.

Do not copy and paste code from the internet. You can look at resources and use it as inspiration, but don't write any code that you don't understand. You should be able to explain every part of any assignment or project when asked.

Be respectful of your classmates and me.

If you have a disability for which you may be requesting accomodation, you are encouraged to let me know so that we can determine reasonable accomodations for this course.
