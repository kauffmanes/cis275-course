## Course Description
This semester we will closely consider the web, think about its impact upon culture, and develop technical skills for generating effective web content. This course focuses primarily upon the development of coding skills for generating web content, as well as an aptitude for creating effective designs and interfaces. In addition, this course is designed to help students develop the ability to produce an informed critique of Internet resources, as well as a capacity for evaluation of web materials <a href="#feecite">(Fee 1)</a>.

The typical class structure will be a video lecture focused on the assigned reading. The rest of the class will involve working on in-class activities and discussions.

## Student Outcomes
As a student in this course, you’ll be exposed to numerous web designs, and you will learn to evaluate and discuss the primary design elements of the Web through both conversation and writing. In addition, you’ll learn how to efficiently program relatively advanced web designs. Finally, you’ll also gain the opportunity to think critically about the web and its influence on our culture, and represent that thought through your own development projects and writing <a href="#feecite">(Fee 1)</a>.

## Course Prerequisites
There are no prerequesites for this course.

## Reference Materials
In addition to these two books, there may be assigned readings based on current topics and events. The Duckett book will be used soon so buy that one first!

1. Duckett, J. (2011). HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites. ISBN-13: 978-1118008188

The only way to really learn this type of content is to do it every week. To that end, I'll be assigning exercises to complete on your own. If you get stuck, visit the PAL tutors, email me to meet before class, or ask questions in class. These exercises will factor into your participation grade, in addition to class contributions, and overall preparedness. You really need to be in attendance to get the most out of this class. If you need to miss, please just let me know.

## Getting Help
There are PAL tutors available to help with your course work. They can be found on the second floor of the Tech Center, either in the lounge.

<a href="mailto:manginogf@washjeff.edu">Gianni Mangino</a>: Monday and Wednesday, 7:00-10:00 PM <br/>
<a href="mailto:berbackrj@washjeff.edu">Ryan Berback</a>: Tuesday, 7:00-10:00 PM

You can also email me at <a href="mailto:ekauffman@washjeff.edu">ekauffman@washjeff.edu</a> with questions. I live in Pittsburgh, so I won't always be in the building to answer questions. I will normally be here by 8:00 AM on class days, so feel free to drop by or email to set something up. I recommend also asking questions and making comments on the class sites, since I'm sure others will have the same question.

## Schedule
This course meets on Tuesdays and Thursday from 9:00 to 10:45 AM in TEK 215. You'll have 24/7 card access to the New Media lab in Room 216 of the tech center. If you have trouble getting in, please let me know.

## Final Notes
Final grades will be impacted by more than three absences. You will lose one point from your final grade for each absence in excess of three. There are no "excused" absences.

Any late assignment will be docked one full letter grade for each day that it's late. You should have plenty of time to complete them with many resources available to you for when you're stuck.

Do not copy and paste code from the internet. Do not copy and paste code from the internet. Do not copy and paste code from the internet. I'll probably Google your code. I'll know. Don't write any code that you don't understand. You should be able to explain every part of any assignment or project when asked.

Be respectful of your classmates and me. Keep your phone away during class unless it's relevant to the discussion. If a classmate or I'm talking, pay attention. Simple stuff.

In order to respect the open learning environment, do not record audio or video of any class without prior permission.

If you have a disability for which you may be requesting accomodation, you are encouraged to let me know so that we can determine reasonable accomodations for this course.
