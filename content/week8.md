# The Exam
I recommend taking the exam the first half of this week. The expectation is that you will have completed it by Sunday at 11:55 PM (the latest Sakai allows for a submission on a day). This includes working out any issues with me if they arise. If you can't download something, I'll need to look into it and fix the issue if appropriate. As per the syllabus, any assignment submitted late is docked a full letter grade for each day that it is late. The exam is open note, book, and internet, but should be done without help from your peers.

## How to Take it
1. Go to https://sakai.washjeff.edu/samigo-app/servlet/Login?id=d23f7388-ecad-4d09-8b63-5a097f32f59a1615803378082. You may need to sign in. It should load "Exam 2: CSS & Design".
1. Read each question thoroughly!
