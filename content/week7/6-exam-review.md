- A table with rows that have an alternating background color
- Navigation section with links inline
- A sidebar to the left with the main content to the right
- A fixed positioned element
- An absolute positioned element
- A relative positioned element
- A local (inline) CSS style (Yeah, it's not great. But you should be able to write/recognize them.)

- Be able to identify how you've followed CRAP principles
- **Extra**: A section of your webpage with a background image set (check out chp. 16 for help)
