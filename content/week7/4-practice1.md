A few weeks ago, we [started a website](/week2/6-practice2) to advertise our new web company, DubJay Designs. We want to revisit this with our new-found CSS knowledge!

# Exercise 1: HTML
Create a new HTML document called `index.html` with all of the typical HTML structural elements. Create a CSS file called `styles.css`. Include the CSS file as an external stylesheet in your `index.html`. Using <a href="https://examples.emilykauffman.com/11-advanced-css/exercise1/index.html">this website</a>, write the HTML to mock up the content. Based on the appearance, try to think about which elements you'll need.

# Exercise 2: CSS
1. After creating all of the HTML elements, add CSS to create the website. Feel free to change the content or colors, but keep the general page sections. If you need more HTMl elements, add them!
1. Check out this page for some font families to choose from: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp. Choose a sans-serif set for the main content, and a serif set for the headings.

# Exercise 3: Styling Links
1. Add a navigation section to the header of your website. Include a Home, About, and Contact links. They don't have to point to actual pages (i.e. just leave the href blank). 
1. Style the links using all of the `<a>` pseudo-tags. Take care to apply them in the correct order (pg. 290).

It should look something like this: https://examples.emilykauffman.com/11-advanced-css/exercise2/index.html

# Exercise 4: Looking at Code
You now have the skills to make most websites designs. Find a few websites that you like. Why do you like them? Check out their code via the inspect element tool. Look at how they've arranged their CSS and HTML. If you see something that interests you, try it out in your code from today.


**Examples**: sticky headers, sticky "back to top" button, color schemes, changing typography

# Exercise 5: Add CSS to Boilerplate
This exercise gives you the opportunity to hook some CSS into the HTML Boilerplate that you created earlier in the course. Through this exercise, you’ll develop the ability to actually modify the appearance of the web content you are building. To successfully complete this task you should be able to exhibit mastery of HTML, and you should also be able to:
1. Determine the best way to implement styles in your coding work
1. Construct effective and efficient CSS statements
1. Generate carefully edited HTML and CSS with absolutely no errors
1. Incorporate the HTML5 structural elements as well as DIVs

Completing this work will inform you of your preparedness for the upcoming CSS exam. It will also set you up nicely to be ready to address the upcoming layout exercise. The more markup practice you engage with, the better your understandings and competence will be.

**Here's what you should do:**
Take your beautiful and efficiently-coded "perfect" HTML5 template and style all the major elements. Create some additional pages to reflect a navigation scheme. Make sure there are absolutely no errors in your HTML or your CSS.

You should make sure your work includes:
1. Multiple HTML pages.
1. Many of the HTML5 structural elements.
1. All the necessary styling for the appearance of the major elements on all pages.
1. Appropriate commenting for all your code in both HTML and CSS.
1. Filler content so that you can observe coding changes.

If you are struggling with any of this, you might want to make sure that you take a look at the code from public websites using the dev console – remember that you can access the CSS from that site also for example code (the process differs form browser to browser). A good example of this is <a href="http://samfee.net">samfee.net</a>. You might also try the exercises in your text which also lay out some of the code for you as well.

**All markup for this project should be in accordance with the HTML5 and CSS3 specifications.**
