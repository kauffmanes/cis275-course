There will be no new content this week. This exam will be worth 15% of your final grade and will be graded for correctness. You will have three hours (a typical class period length) to take the it.

# The Exam
I recommend taking the exam the first half of this week. The expectation is that you will have completed it by Sunday at 11:55 PM (the latest Sakai allows for a submission on a day). This includes working out any issues with me if they arise. If you can't download something, I'll need to look into it and fix the issue if appropriate. As per the syllabus, any assignment submitted late is docked a full letter grade for each day that it is late. The exam is open note, book, and internet, but should be done without help from your peers.

## How to Take it
1. Go to https://sakai.washjeff.edu/samigo-app/servlet/Login?id=d23f7388-ecad-4d09-8b63-5a097f32f59a1613974971429. You may need to sign in. It should load "Exam 1: HTML".
1. Some questions will have question text with the prompt, as well as an attachment that includes an `.html` document. Download this attachment to your own computer. It may be helpful to make a new folder called "Exam1" or something, to organize these documents.
1. Read the question prompt and make any appropriate changes to the downloaded file. When you're done, save the file and upload it using the File Upload section in the question.
1. Repeat for each question.

If you have outstanding questions, remember that we have weekly PAL tutors that have taken this course. Use them!
