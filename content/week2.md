# Troubleshooting Techniques
`youtube:TPw7oZCB8Fs`

<!-- make a codepen for demoing these -->
1. Remember - HTML files should always have an `.html` extension so they open in a browser. Test by double-clicking on your files.
1. Make sure nothing is outside of your `doctype`.
1. Make sure to answer the question - asked for definition list, got unordered lists, paragraphs, etc.
1. In your head section - two elements you’ll always want to include are the charset and title. If you don’t include the charset, sometimes special characters can render incorrectly.
1. When you make a tag, make the first and last immediately: `<html></html>`
1. If an element is inside another one, it should be indented for readibility.
1. The actual elements don't show up in the browser - the content does, elements just describe the content
1. If something is displaying incorrectly, go through each of your tags. Find the starting and ending tag.
1. If something isn't displaying at all, make sure you have a body tag and your missing element is inside of it.
1. Keyboard shortcuts (save, copy/paste/cut, select)
1. Copy and paste your code into the <a target="_blank" href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">W3 Validator</a>.

# Remember - the ideal way to learn and retain this information is to:
1. Review the Learning Goals
1. On any page, just go through the content in order. This could mean watching a video and then reading the content under it, or vice versa
1. On the exercises page - do the Knowledge Review
1. Go back and review answers you got wrong
1. Complete the exercises
1. Send them to me by 11:59 PM Sunday evening
