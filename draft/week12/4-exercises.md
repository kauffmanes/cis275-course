Through this exercise, you'll develop the ability to test your understandings of Responsive Web Design (RWD). Specifically, you should implement fluid layouts, flexible images, and media queries. To successfully complete this task, you should be able to exhibit mastery of the objectives from Exercises 1-5, and you should also:
1. Understand the elements that constitute RWD and how to employ them
1. Demonstrate basic abilities with flexbox
1. Generate carefully edited HTML and CSS with absolutely no errors
1. Target your designs on multiple platforms and browsers

*Here's what you should do:*
Generate two files - one HTML file and corresponding external stylesheet for controlling layout and appearance.

You should make sure your work includes:
1. All styling for appearance and layout on multiple devices and browsers
1. Appropriate comments for all your code
1. The traditional lorem ipsum filler text
1. A navigation area with three options using flexbox
1. At least one image embedded in the content of the page

This represents the minimum you should do to successfully complete the exercise. You
should feel free to go further â€“ such practice will only improve your skills. In the end
your browser might display something like this:

## Next Class
Next class, we're going to be doing more work with responsive web design.

On the 30th, we're going to do a partner usability study on each others websites. **We are going to use our 9:00-10:45 AM class time to do this.** This means that
you'll be logging on during our normal class time. If this is a problem, please let me know immediately so we can come up with an alternative. Decide on your partner and one of you should email me (or message me on Teams) you and your partner's name by the end of the day, Sunday, April 26th. If you do not have a partner, let me know as soon as you can and I'll pair you with someone.
