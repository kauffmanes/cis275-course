## Next Class
- **Homework**: Homework #3 DUE ON THE 20th, not on the 18th.
- **Extra credit**: Visit a PAL tutor during hours. Have them sign a piece of paper with their name and date. Write down what they helped you with. Give it to me for a bonus point toward something.
- **Optional practice**: Make a codecademy.com account (free) and start the HTML track.
