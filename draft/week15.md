## Conclusion
Thanks to everyone for doing a great job this semester and for rolling with all of the changes that came our way. I had a good time teaching you what I know, and I hope that you all got something out of it. I'm really excited to see everyone's final projects, and I hope that non-Seniors continue with the advanced web class next year. If anyone has any questions about anything in the future, please email me at <a href="mailto:kauffmanes@gmail.com">kauffmanes@gmail.com</a>. I will always be around to answer questions about resumes, jobs, code, projects, or my favorite breweries in Pittsburgh. I wish you all luck!
