## Homework
**Due**: Feb 20<br/>

As we begin to move into CSS, this exercise will give you the opportunity to create an HTML template that you can use later to easily dump content into, and work through the CSS. In other words, through this exercise you’ll develop a starting point where you can always return without having to look up all the typical HTML syntax over and over again. To successfully complete this assignment, you should exhibit mastery of all the items addressed in Exercises 1 & 2, and you should also be able to:
1. Create a comprehensive HEAD section with common META tags
1. Generate carefully edited HTML with absolutely no errors
1. Incorporate the HTML5 structural elements into the BODY section
1. Understand what DIVs/SPANs are and be able to implement them accordingly

There isn’t a grade for this – we will review each other’s work in class. But, carefully completing this exercise will make your life much easier for the remainder of the term and it will also reduce the overall amount of work you have to do for the upcoming exercises and projects.

*Here's what you should do:*
Generate one, truly beautiful, HTML file. Make sure there are absolutely no errors in it. This means that you should go through the troubleshooting process that we outlined in class, including running your file through a validator.

Your file should include:
1. All of the common and frequently used META tags.
1. Most (if not all) of the HTML structural elements.
1. Your best effort at generating a navigation structure.
1. Careful commenting of your code so that you understand what each section of the file is doing.
1. Some fake content (think Lorem Ipsum text) so that you can see what goes where when you are opening the file in a browser (https://loremipsum.io/ultimate-list-of-lorem-ipsum-generators/).

All markup for this project should be in accordance with the HTML5.2 specification.
