## Quick Overview of Krug 11-12
We ran out of time to cover chapters 11-12, so please read them on your own if you're planning on being a web developer in the future. Chapter 11 talks about how we go into a site with a measure of goodwill, and the problems that we encounter lower that goodwill until we leave the site. Depending on the situation of the user (are they in a hurry, are they already upset), this amount of goodwill might be lower to start with. Make your site a place that users can come and easily find what they need to: usability as a common courtesy.

Chapter 12 discusses accessibility and why we should make efforts to make our sites accessible. Not only does a large % of the population *have* some type of disability, it's the right thing to do. We as developers have the opportunity to drastically improve the lives of some people, so why wouldn't we make the effort to do so?
