## In Class Exercises

### Part 1: Finish last class's exercises
If you want to work on this more, now is the time. When/if you're done, comment the following on today's class site:
1. Something you found that was challenging
1. Something you found that you thought was interesting
1. Something you'd like more practice with or further explanation on, if anything

### Part 2: Finish the homework
1. Where appropriate, replace your existing structural elements with the HTML5 elements we've covered from today.
1. Once you've completed the homework, zip the project and email it to me. Don't spend all of class working on this so you have time to start today's exercises. When you're ready to move on, email it to me. I won't be grading for correctness - just to see where everyone is at with the course content so I can adjust my timeline for after spring break.

### Part 3: More Practice!
Choose an event that's coming up and make a website for it. Include the following elements:
- Color scheme: think back to [design basics lecture](/teaching/cis-275/design-basics). Be able to explain why you selected it.
- At least one custom font NOT included in the list of accepted web fonts (i.e. download one from the web and include it in your CSS). Check out Google Fonts or FontSquirrel for free fonts.
- A table with rows that have an alternating background color
- Navigation section with links inline
- A sidebar to the left with the main content to the right
- A fixed positioned element
- An absolute positioned element
- A relative positioned element
- A local (inline) CSS style (Yeah, it's not great. But you should be able to write/recognize them.)
- Use at least five of the HTML5 structural elements we covered today
- Be able to identify how you've followed CRAP principles
- **Extra**: A section of your webpage with a background image set (check out chp. 16 for help)
